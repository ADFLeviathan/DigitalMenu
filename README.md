Digital menu for a pizzeria 

This project is the result of the collaboration of five people who were asked to work together on the development of a digital menu for a pizzeria.

As you can see, at the top there is a menu with various product categories. By clicking on them, the user is directed to the corresponding section of the page. Clicking on "EN", on the other hand, takes the visitor to the English version of the page.

In the middle, there are the menus and a button that, when clicked, takes the user back to the top of the page. At the bottom, there's a footer.
